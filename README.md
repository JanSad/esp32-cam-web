- Automatically starts streaming after power-up

## Hardware Requirements

- AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM module  
- ESP32-CAM USB programming base (dedicated board with USB and reset circuitry)  
- USB cable for power and flashing  

## Usage

1. Flash the firmware to the ESP32-CAM using ESP-IDF or precompiled binary.
